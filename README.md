# WaterPumpPowerConverter

# Summary
This repository contains a Switch Mode Power Supply(SMPS) that is used to power and control the water pumps developed for the various water fountains on Thingiverse. The SMPS module is based around the LM2596 chip. As well as this, a 3D printable case was developed using Fusion 360. The 3D Model of the PCB is shown below:
