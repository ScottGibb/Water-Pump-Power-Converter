# WaterPumpPowerConverter

# Summary
This repository contains a Switch Mode Power Supply(SMPS) that is used to power and control the water pumps developed for the various water fountains on Thingiverse. The SMPS module is based around the LM2596 chip. As well as this, a 3D printable case was developed using Fusion 360. The 3D Model of the PCB is shown below:

# Design
As for the design, I designed the circuit to use existing parts that I already had from previous projecs, this is why it consists of all through hole components. There is a lot of improvements that can be made to this design which are outlined below in the improvement section. As for the design, it was ordered through JLCPCB and is shown below:
